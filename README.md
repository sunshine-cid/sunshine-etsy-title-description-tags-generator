For the time being, in 64-bit Windows, a special version of BardAPI is required. If you're runnign 64-bit Windows use: 
>pip install bardapi==0.1.23a

Otherwise you can use the standard:
>pip install bardapi

From there usage should be as simple as runniing main.py and inputting the necessary cookie values from an incognito Bard session
